# Scheduler
One of the most important tools i use to keep my day organized is a daily scheduled ods/excel file where i plan the tasks  that needs to be finished each day a night before, thats when a problem has arised :) ,
I am too lazy to scroll through a file and explore it for 2 minutes so i decided to have the classic developer experience and spent X hours developing a tool to help me ADD/EDIT/DISPLAY tasks from the command-line interface and save it in my schedule ods file

# Flow chart
